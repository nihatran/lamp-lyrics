        lyrics: `Shadows of the night strike against the window
        Filling this city covered in stardust
        To return by your side
        I begin to doze off
        Rainbow-colored neon lights, a town parade
        Two lovers waiting for a love that would never return
        As if in search for a continuation of their dream
        They silently close their eyes
        A pleasant dizziness
        The lights shivering
        I write down
        A melody and its abstract lyrics I'd nearly forgotten
        Shadows of the night strike against the window
        Filling this city covered in stardust
        In complete stillness
        A single fragment of a solitary cloud separates from the rest
        Sitting down on a chair that feels like a memory
        As I look up at the indigo blue sky through my fingers
        A flower quietly swaying by the waterside
        Suddenly blooms as if in a dream
        Sounds of bossa nova leaking out
        The distant roar of the sea
        Ah, the night is so thick
        It hides you within the seasons
        A hundred miles of moonlight
        Throwing off the hands of my watch
        (Nostalgia)
        (You are a melody)
        Like mist on the surface of a broken street light
        You begin to fade
        As serenity descends upon my shoulders`

        lyrics: `The tranquility after the rain that smoked white
        In an old movie, olive colored trench coat and high heels
        Back view of the last scene
        The evening of the meeting is dyed blue
        Under a dark gas light
        An office district on the weekend with nobody
        The hand of the silver wristwatch are ticking... (tick-tick-tick)
        Tonight is the end of autumn
        Sans-serif typeface spilling from the lips
        You will remember every time the seasons change
        Like a fur coat in December
        I'm sure we can't walk on the snow anymore
        I won't say goodbye at the end of autumn
        I was dreaming in the gap between you and the building that disappeared in the drizzle
        If you want to stay like this, your love will end
        The transparent elevator will drop us down
        When the next morning is welcomed
        Reflected in the skyscraper, there will be a short end roll
        City A (Alpha) where the shining glass moon is hazy
        Red Marunouchi Line
        A love pattern bleeding into cold thick fog tonight
        Rewound the last scene`

        lyrics: `Strawberry jam
        The town is velvet with an overcast sky
        A midnight plane flies through the centre of the sky
        Raspberry night
        Dialing the number I just learned
        I can hear the notes of winter on the other end of the receiver
        Your side profile, your red lips
        A waltz of powdered snow
        Written on the stave of the northern wind
        Cranberry kiss
        A sweet melody
        An eternal tune
        I wonder if you recognized our late-night password
        After the sigh that extinguished the candlelight
        We entered our dreams
        To be enveloped in a pear-coloured dawn
        Deeper into dreams`,

        lyrics: `Two people in a room
        Old records that I always listened to
        Dropping the record needle
        Which started spinning memories and melodies
        Cloudy bathroom on a cold day
        A dream spun with an arpeggio
        About the lover with the acronym K
        Till the morning breaks on the curtains swaying at the window
        You & Me, talked forever
        A balcony overlooking the tranquil blue city
        Like a love story on the penthouse that extends into the night sky
        It flowed from the speaker
        I close my eyes and remember on this sad night
        The summer day with lemon soda and iced tea when we met
        A sunny afternoon casts a shadow on you
        Lover with the acronym K
        We will surely meet again someday
        Till the night in a room with the west sun plunging in
        You & Me, noisy love
        Purple gradation soaked into the glass window
        I felt like
        I was sure it would continue forever
        The last piano phrase disappears and the song ends
        The two will leave this room now`,

        lyrics: `They slept in the still dark morning of winter
        6:30
        Your fingertips that stopped the alarm
        It rains
        Waking up from a dream and lighting a cigarette
        Exhaling peppermint smoke
        I remember the sky being gray
        Red stripes
        Wrapping the muffler you gave me
        I sway in the yellow local trains
        An empty heart
        The sound of rain falling slowly
        The absence of you and your silky black hair
        A winter-colored sky reflects off a puddle
        White sneakers wet from the rain
        The weather today makes me melancholy
        Hurrying to walk the city
        Forgetting in the spring
        Waking up from a dream and lighting a cigarette
        Exhaling peppermint smoke
        I remember the sky being gray`,

        lyrics: `The back alley where the convectional rain suddenly rises
        A chord woven by the sound of splashing raindrops
        The echoes of the lazy 5 o'clock siren is fading
        Two people close to the approaching evening beach
        The wind is swaying in the watercolor season
        After a rainy afternoon like I had dreamed of someday
        Muttering a collection of short stories
        I want to go somewhere far away as it is
        Soaked in asphalt after being washed away
        A chord that weaves the melancholy of two people
        The incense of sweet gardenia flowers wafting around the corner
        Summer passes quietly on the main street
        The scenery reflects off a the decorative window in July
        Sticking cheeks to a coffee shop on the weekend
        Wearing a striped shirt, a lover and two others
        The blue landscape continues forever as it is`

        lyrics: `Smoky drizzles fill the landscape
        In a bleeding twilight marking the end of spring
        Finding you among flowers that pop open like an umbrella
        Waiting alone at the bus stop in front of the station for the promised 6:30 appointment
        Diffused reflections on rain-soaked roads
        Splashing puddles dye the hem
        A car runs away past my eyes
        Leaving me back
        Crossing railroad lines traverse the scene
        As darkness breaks through the weir and overflows into the city
        Fluttering and swaying lights illuminating the platform lights
        Excited by someone you don't know is like you and unlike you
        Combing the tips of hair wet from the rain
        When I suddenly saw you
        Nothing changed the night like that
        Into a gentle dream
        The flowers scattered without saying goodbye
        Leaving a white afterimage`

        lyrics: `I don't want to remember you yet
        I know I won't go back anymore
        The silver constellations passing through the city tonight
        Wrapped in the sunrise to the other side of the river
        The memory of spring is brought back by the wind
        In which the two should have been separated
        Tears suddenly overflowed
        Now again, with you
        I'm became a little lonely spending time at the transition of the city
        Counting the seasons that passed
        I'm in a station building that no one knows anymore
        A nostalgic figure floated past
        I can't get used to the days I spend alone
        I just wrote down the words that I couldn't reach anymore
        My tears in the dry winter
        The kindness of a rolling drop
        My sigh is white and cold
        As I remember you
        The room where time was spent, will remain the same beyond the slope
        A old and small apartment
        Through that alley where the Daphne flowers bloom
        I wish to see that nostalgic face again`

        You are still sleeping quietly
        Little by little, the orange sun peeped from behind the building roof
        I felt like spring would come when it lit up the city
        Opening the window and exhaling
        I watched the trails of smoke for a while
        The seasons pass through the room where the light flutters
        Leaving two people asleep on a cold morning
        The steam of coffee warming the room
        Listening to the weather forecast on the radio
        It seemed like winter was still here to stay
        We are sure to bloom and spread
        Like a flower from a corner of the city
        The confetti of light and shadow passing through the glass
        Scattering, to let you know that time shall certainly pass to`,

        lyrics: `The horizon and the sweet ocean breeze at summer's end
        Blowing through the girl's hair she'd only just cut short
        Melancholy carried by a freight train running across the seashore
        Tears and the prologue to a kiss hidden inside a seashell
        A summer bluer than the sea…
        Memories now flowing from the car stereo
        The sound of the waves and your singing
        In the vast loneliness of a late-summer beach at dusk
        Chasing after the shadow of her straw hat blown away by the wind
        Running across the beach with her toenails painted red
        Creating ripples in the water
        The epilogue to a fairytale about a mermaid she'd nearly forgotten
        A summer deeper than the sea…
        Ah, resounding from the far corners of my memory
        The sound of the waves and your singing
        I always knew it would end like this one day
        Our brief time together
        Like a drop of foam fading into the bottom of the ocean
        Even if you were a fish I would still find you
        Endlessly I keep calling out your name
        Where are you singing now?`
