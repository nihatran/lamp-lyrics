        lyrics: `The years have quickly passed since the days of grief
        All of my thought is woven and
        The town that has forgotten that means trembles
        My mind is watching at your vacant side face, and My mind wanders like a waterfowl left behind by the seasons.
        A repetition of sighs grasps my sleeve
        In early spring, just like slumbering afternoons spilling over, 
        I will trace the footsteps of the landscape
        In the rainy morning waiting for the summer, 
        within the sound of rain ticking away the time, I see one blink going away
        It's all a conventional story
        I will leave the story behind and walk away
        I had several boring nights lined up
        in the bottom of the quietly flowing time
        I remembered me on the day when heat hazes were shimmering
        The bright colors and even your words are a happening that just falls
        In early spring, just like slumbering afternoons spilling over, 
        I will trace the footsteps of the landscape
        In the wind calling for the summer, 
        the spring that we spent alone together is fading away
        That sorrowful landscape is gone forever`

        lyrics: `April Romantique is riding on the fragrance of the Spring
        The night of the beginning, un, deux, trois, starts to rotate
        The colors of the water are passing each other on the capricious season
        A day is mingled with a lie and a truth
        Vouvoyer, As yet, the two of us have just met
        There were our overlapping eye glances and a sweet silence
        All over the city is at the bottom of the sea
        We will dance with our eyelids stained with the blue spilled down
        Tutoyer, Right now, just like two lovers, the two of us are 
        lacking the words to speak to, and are in sorrow
        Eventually the sky turns dimly white and the night begins to 
        melt away
        The flowers and the stars have faded 
        their color at the edge of the water
        The Spring et Patati et Patata
        Chatting is a swimming April fish
        The Spring film noir 
        A beautiful, brief, night story`

        lyrics: `As it is at 4 a.m. in the morning
        As it is, we two are going to
        meet in the world of dreams
        In our mutual dreams,
        we are mutually lovers
        We will go to sleep with our hands joined together`

        lyrics: `Right now, you are going past in front of me, and you are exposing your transparent skin
        Did the blue waves tempt you to come to the beach alone? 
        I asked you that in my mind
        My doubt prevent me from speaking out conventional words
        Your attention goes to surfriders in the sea
        I will scatter a piece of little love again this summer
        On the beach where summer sun shines and 
        southern wind blows, my hot wishes are scorching my heart
        1, who could not win your attention is now staring
        at the footprints you made and you are gone
        I will scatter a piece of little love again this summer
        Everlasting summer surfriders are riding on the ocean horizon
        In less than one hour, we will have rain
        The long beach is crowded with various color of parasols
        The wave sparkling, the sea roaring,
        and I, who is unbearable will be the beach breeze
        O splashing waves, do not forget the season called the summer
        When the sun sets over the sea, I will go home
        I will scatter a piece of little love again this summer`

        lyrics: `It begins to rain
        It wets your eyes
        A morning of farewell is coming to this room
        The days of flowers bloomed in profusion are misty in the distance
        A morning of farewell is coming to this town as well
        "By the time when the morning comes, you surely will forget it"
        An instant of your awfully brief words implying
        When flowers bloomed in profusion, we two had a dream
        What skimmed my cheek was the fragrance of the season we loved
        When the night came, we spent our time with idle talk
        It is just like we are in a dream that never ends
        Forever
        It begins to rain
        It wets shoulders of two of us
        A morning of farewell is coming to this town
        When flowers bloomed in profusion, we two had a dream
        I say goodbye to the impression of your face that lingers
        Goodbye`

        lyrics: `On a well sunny day, you are jocularly holding up a rain umbrella
        And you are blowing your out of tune whistle
        You are hanging a deep crimson bag on your left arm
        And you are wearing a spilt polka-dotted one-piece dress
        With your worn out rouge on your cheeks, you sat down with a flop
        Moreover, from a countrified rustic stone staircase, 
        You are staring at a feeble cicada with your distant eyes
        If you take a too long recess,
        You see, ivy is twining itself around you
        When the sun gets dark, the madder red sky is giving a sigh
        The melody of an accordion visiting from somewhere seems to whisper faintly
        On a well sunny day, you are jocularly putting up a rain umbrella
        And you are blowing your out of tune whistle
        You are hanging a deep crimson bag on your left arm
        And you are wearing a spilt polka-dotted one-piece dress
        Has the handmade flower hairpin you made wilted?
        Your red string of fate is still caught in your hand
        I'm sure that you want to play cat's cradle with that string`
