        lyrics: `I chase after you, and the fleeing season
        In this unfamiliar town, I got lost
        and was enveloped in a scent that was somehow painful
        Standing still, I let the things
        that cross the back of my closed eyes pass
        At the sound of a distant bell,
        I have come to meet you
        And then the two of us...
        You, with the chestnut eyes, bounce along lightly
        Just the two of us walk down this long hilly road
        on a windy afternoon
        This love soars along with the wind
        and the hazy sky is brilliantly dyed
        Our shadows sway
        Are you laughing, just a little?
        And so you...
        Before night comes, I'll say it
        in my collected words
        It's a bit long, so it's all right even if you ignore it...
        my feelings toward you
        And then the two of us...
        You, with the chestnut eyes, bounce along lightly
        Just the two of us walk down this long hilly road
        on a windy afternoon
        Before night comes, I'll say it
        in my collected words
        It's a bit long, so it's all right even if you ignore it...
        my feelings toward you`

        lyrics: `I woke up in the morning and opened the window
        That rain was falling in the garden
        Slightly cold air this morning
        Once again, I crawl into bed
        And the sound of the engine on the front street
        Wrapped in the song of raindrops
        Rain is always different
        Rain is always a scene
        Rain is your kindness
        Falling rain drops reflect flowering blossoms
        In the morning light that comes
        I lost the rest of my dream
        Walking down the street in the rain
        And the people who pass by are melancholic
        The rhythm has been the same since this morning
        The song of raindrops is engraved into the city
        Rain is always different
        Rain is always a scene
        Rain is your kindness
        Falling rain drops reflect flowering blossoms
        The rainy city is like June
        The hydrangea flowers are beautiful
        Puddles of water on the street
        Flushed down to the ground
        Rain is always different
        Rain is always a scene
        Rain is your kindness
        Falling rain drops reflect flowering blossoms`

        lyrics: `I can't remember the sweet love poems I used to love to listen to
        The excuses you left behind and the cloudy skies get in the way
        The night rain drenches my shoes
        I'm running to you
        I'd breathe softly and watch it drift away
        Alone with you... a sad melody
        I wonder if you've always been yourself, even when I was like that
        The night rain drenches my face
        Those were never tears
        The rain is so heavy
        Under the street lamps
        Shadows waiting with our umbrellas
        Bathing in the rain of light
        The night rain drenches my heart
        I'm running to you
        The rain is so heavy`

        lyrics: `Blue winds bring the night to the city
        The rising moon melts into the night sky
        Lovers lean in close and whisper to each other
        I can almost touch the shattered stars
        Is this a dream?
        I've seen it somewhere before
        You're so beautiful tonight
        Neon lights in the windows
        If it starts to tremble deep inside your eyes
        The night will be vibrant
        The lights of the city are like velvet
        Is this a dream?
        Walking with you at night
        I'm happy tonight
        I'm headed to see the lights
        And I'll be right by your side
        Blue winds bring the night to the city
        The rising moon melts into the night sky
        Lovers lean in close and whisper to each other
        I can almost touch the shattered stars`

        lyrics: `Breathe out a white breath
        Down a lonely street
        I woke up a little earlier than usual on a winter morning
        White is dancing in the sky
        In a lonely park
        Arms tucked away in long sleeves, you're happy with the warmth
        Saturday afternoon, I went to a coffee shop on the corner
        With a hidden gift to give to that girl
        But I'm a little late to meet her
        Everyone's being colored white
        The streets are silent and dark
        I blame winter for why I held your hand
        Saturday afternoon, I went to a coffee shop on the corner
        With a hidden gift to give to that girl
        But I'm a little late to meet her`

        lyrics: `I see your silhouette through my apartment window
        Your image behind the light blue curtains
        I pretend to look at the night sky from my window
        Can you see me from there?
        Little by little, the wind
        Carries me into your room
        I'm sure this thought will reach your heart
        If you water the flowers on my window sill
        Let the warm wind blow
        Breeze after breeze
        Through the window of your room
        Let it carry my thoughts to your heart
        When night comes and the light in your room goes out
        At any moment my heart will run out to meet yours
        The lights of the city leaking in through my window
        And the cold night breeze that sometimes blows`
