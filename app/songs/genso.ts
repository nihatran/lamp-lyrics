        lyrics: `Spring is there outside of the window
        It's passing by without a sound
        I was thinking about him and her
        A shallow afternoon
        I'm obsessed with something unimportant
        The days I yearned for
        Are calling out to me
        I can feel it
        Outside of the window the rain on the street
        Began to fall quietly`

        lyrics: `Stagnant, my room today is stagnant
        I don't even notice the rain outside
        The opaque shadow of the room hangs densely on my fingers
        I can't find the words to recall it
        Sinking, it sinks into a rainy Monday
        I don't even notice the rain outside
        Past the windowpane, clouds pass by
        The end of the days I spent with you
        The gentle light blue afternoon
        I'm half-asleep
        Shadows and light rain down incessantly
        I like you
        Ah, am I not suitable now?
        Ah, am I unfit once again?`

        lyrics: `Towards clear flowers
        When I bring my lips near
        You face this way
        With a smile like spring
        Watching the petals that fall
        The pinwheel in my hand
        Continues to turn
        The time I yearned
        Idly passes by
        I like you
        I like you
        With the wind's breeze
        The petals have fallen into the pond
        I peer in
        To see a shadow reflected on water
        You gave me an orange ohajiki
        In the warmth of spring
        I lied down and smiled
        The time I yearned
        Idly passes by
        I like you
        I like you
        I like you
        I like you`
