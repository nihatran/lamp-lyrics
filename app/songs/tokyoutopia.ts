        lyrics: `High-rise buildings, in the whereabouts of bleeding light
        Wetting my shoulders and walking
        On a rainy Monday
        The night goes on vaguely
        A ferry whistle rushes into the city in the distance
        Focusing on the rhythm of the waves
        A long winter keeps them away
        From lips that passed each other
        Sad scenery is spilled
        The shadows that surrounded the street
        Float in the forgotten remains
        At night, when the starlight does not reach
        In the morning coming soon
        You too will be reflected in the drops falling repeatedly
        And will be washed away, as I look on
        Two people who met somewhere, someday
        When I was struck by your uncertain swaying image
        Remembering you from a distant journey
        The pebbles of light that burst through the night
        Illuminate the illusion
        At least in a dream, I want to hug you and sleep`,

        lyrics: `Winter, a little too long for two people
        When I am somewhere far away
        Winter, outside the cold window
        City lights are swaying blue
        Winter, the vestiges of a season we spent together
        Let's say goodbye now
        Winter, the vestiges of a season we spent together
        Let's say goodbye now
        Your image reflects off the frozen road at night
        The wind asks me
        To mask the tears that had spilled
        I wanted to meet you who had fallen
        Winter, tonight with you- someone I don't know
        I can still hear the cold wind
        In the night city where you sleep a little
        Your lingering sound from far away
        Blows in the wind and whistles
        Your skin and voice are white: a hint of the season in your dreams
        Only a foggy sigh remained on the street corner
        That was so cold that the white windowpane turned cloudy
        With white shimmering winter constellation
        Cold coffee shaking in a cup
        Winter, goodbye sinking cityscape
        Riding the night train
        I'm going on a journey to some distance place`
