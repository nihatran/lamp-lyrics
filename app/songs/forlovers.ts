    It melted away without me noticing
    Alone in this moving scenery
    I stand still and think of you`

    lyrics: `Rising up with someone's feelings, a rain shower starts to drench the town at dusk
    A girl without an umbrella, with her black hair wet, where is she going?
    To the other side of the bridge
    If I could escape to a town that's far by bus...
    Where shall I go tonight?
    Even though this quiet town has nothing
    Where shall I go tonight?
    My normality is overlapping
    The end of a season, and spreading tears in the sky
    Sitting at a window seat, what should I devote my thoughts to?
    I'm all alone
    The tea water is cloudy but I'll take a long gulp, through the glass
    The rain today doesn't seem to be stopping...
    Won't you come to my room tonight?
    Even though there's nothing
    Won't you come to my room tonight?
    Ah, the distant lights...
    The end of a season, and spreading flower petals along the sidewalk
    The end of a season, and then spreading flower petals
    The end of a season, and then spreading tears`

    name: "Last Train At 25 O'clock",
    lyrics: `You and I simply walked, under the cold sky in the dark city
    The words I said disappeared in the night sky
    Just a sigh on the windowpane that reflected you
    Keep your cold, white hands in my pocket
    A light sleep descending from the clear winter sky
    The city panorama stretches out where the neon lights disappear
    The last train leaves the platform leaving two people behind
    The echo of the bell sinks into the night
    If we hold hands and look up at the starry sky, you and I will fly alone through the night
    You and I were standing together in the silence that accompanied 25:00
    The white mist of your sigh looked cold in the dim fluorescent lights casting shadows
    When you look up, a meteor blinks out beyond your line of sight
    A monochrome cityscape under the small night sky
    The taillights are leaving the panoramic city
    The last train leaves the platform leaving two people behind
    The echo of the bell sinks into the night
    If we hold hands and look up at the starry sky, you and I will fly alone through the night
    Until the last train disappears from the platform, I will run till the other side of this night
    The two of us
    Under the cold sky`

    lyrics: `I'm more crazy about this love than you are
    I thought so from the beginning
    On a Sunday, a year after we first met
    You softly said goodbye to me
    Your ambiguous words made my heart ache
    So the end has come, has it?
    You nodded as if to say yes
    Long shadows in the distance It's funny how stunned I am
    I wonder if one day I'll forget you
    Will I one day fall in love with someone else?
    On a Sunday when you're not here, when I have no plans
    I brush my hair and go out on the town
    The sky is clear and the wind is gentle
    The hem of my skirt swaying lightly
    The sweet, sad melody that we used to love
    I can hear it from somewhere
    I feel like I'm about to cry
    I look up at the scaly clouds fading into the dusk
    I wonder if the day will come when I will forget you
    Will I one day fall in love with someone else?
    I loved your smile, your mannerisms, and your gentle voice
    I'll never see you again`

    lyrics: `The sea in September is fading in color
    In the waves, the shadows of the departed 
    summer appear and disappear
    Amidst the sparsely populated shore,
    people are carried away by the sounds
    And yes, I find myself thinking of you
    I linger in nameless seasons
    Just throwing my thoughts
    Into the gaps of the grey sky
    The wind gently, playfully caresses my
    cheek and disappears into the sand
    The wind will surely reach your town
    and gently sway your hair
    My heart leaps, and my footsteps are light
    Though I came all the way to the distant sea alone
    I somehow start to feel a little lonely
    Yes, I begin to long to hear your voice
    I pretend not to notice
    Coming from somewhere
    Those footsteps that urge me on
    The wind softly grazes my cheek from
    the right and flows gently
    Tomorrow, I will surely go to the town
    where you live and convey my feelings to you
    The wind gently, playfully caresses my 
    cheek and disappears into the sand
    Tomorrow, I will surely go to the town 
    where you live and convey my feelings to you`

    lyrics: `The falling rain
    An unchanging sky
    In a grey city, I met that person
    Footsteps pass by without notice
    Gently calling out and looking back from under the elm tree
    I wish the clock stopped for a while just like this
    The casual chatter spilling past my ears
    A love letter spelled out in rainwater, slides down a closed umbrella
    Little by little, I am going like you, little by little
    This fleeting feeling fades away, in the the 
    continuous rain that obscures it
    The falling rain
    The midnight sky
    That man, what is he doing tonight?
    A sweet memory spreads in my heart
    Like sugar cubes that crumble in hot black tea
    Before falling asleep, I look at the night sky and reminisce
    And confess my love to the lemon-like moon
    A love letter spelled out in a sigh, on a foggy windowpane
    Little by little, I am going like you, little by little
    Closing my eyes, to the scent of midnight and the gentle sound of rain`

    name: "Words Of Love",
    lyrics: `The night comes quietly
    It talks to me softly
    Let's whisper the words of love
    The city colored faintly, as the round moon rises
    The winter breeze outside the swaying window
    Opening the curtain a little and looking out by myself
    Around this time
    I'm sure you're heading to this room
    From somewhere under this sky
    Hugging your thin shoulders
    I'll talk to you softly
    Let's whisper the words of love
    I want to keep dancing all night in this spinning world with my girl
    The orange light that dyes the room, gently wrapping that girl and me
    I would chase the rolling stars in the monochrome night sky
    Until that girl comes to this room`

    name: "Behind The Moon Shadow",
    lyrics: `As I watched the white waves floating on the moonlit night
    A distant memory that I had forgotten flowed to the sandy beach
    In the summer sky with scattered stardust, heartbeats are rising
    The words of love about to disappear, they stored them in a shell
    Searching for a beautiful star because they wanted to do this forever
    Walking along the sea on such a nice night
    Hidden behind the moon, are a midsummer night's tales
    All those lunar tides crushing the love of two people
    In the rough beach breeze of the coast
    The tides, rising and the waves, hitting the rocks
    Bouncing and wetting their arms
    With blurred lights in the distance shaking along a line
    Sleeping on your shoulders on such a nice night
    Hidden behind the moon, are a midsummer night's tales
    All those lunar tides crushing the love of two people`
