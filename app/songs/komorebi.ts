        lyrics: `A shining white-cold morning
        A winter's day reflected in the dew drops
        The winds up to the skies appear to be grieving
        This road that we always walked on, has passed in time
        Dozing weekend, buzzing city
        Walking and talking, tiring days
        Running through in a hurry as my coat gets flipped inside out
        Floating on the water, to overtake February
        The season when we fell in love, is being carried by the winds
        Passing through the insides of crowds, I'm all alone
        To the rumored city, I'm bidding goodbye
        When I slowly continue to climb the slope
        It's the season of tree-filtered sunlight
        When time begins to flow mischievously
        And words of love are left behind
        Running through in a hurry as my coat gets flipped inside out
        Floating on the water, to overtake February
        The season when we fell in love, is being carried by the winds
        Dazzling back, as if talking to the light
        In the glittering shadows, fingertips playing
        Finally, the season when we fell in love is being carried by the winds
        Gently passing by like graceful days`

        lyrics: `As if lured by the night wind, Today I woke up
        alone again and I got out of bed
        Light blue moonlight is spilling through the swinging curtains
        When I throw myself down on a carpet soaked with melancholy, 
        even when I open the page I was halfway through reading,
        my mind remains somewhat absent
        I'm forgetting about the sequel of the dream I had back then
        There are several wishes under the pillow
        A bookmark of fallen leaves of some day flutters down
        Wine left in the glass
        Tiny abandoned bubbles float
        Faintly audible, the voices of insects
        are playing silence and melancholy
        The blanket that absorbed my tears is cold
        Even if I chant my lover's name, it only smokes white on my lips
        I want to stay like this a little longer
        I want to be swayed by this soft wind until the night dawns
        Whether you are in this room or not`

        lyrics: `A conversation-less passenger car headed nowhere
        Memories of days past hang in the air like wings
        It's just as always, this enveloping world
        Stealing up on me without a word or sound
        Suspended neon signs; a lie by the window
        I hold my breath at the bottom of the universe
        I have heard the sound of unending sorrow
        The gentle embrace of this cold night light is all I need
        Who would think of this town as it floats past unnoticed
        Illuminated only by the cold night light?
        Coffee stains remain on the letter
        With words left unsaid, simply abandoned
        Is it the same as always, the life you're living?
        A gentle kiss before drifting off to sleep
        A winter illusion of a distant spring
        Now-forgotten songs of days gone by
        An unending silence fills the sky
        My heart shaken by the cold night light
        Quietly take with you these rusted feelings
        Oh, cold night light, just like this…
        Alone, humming an endless song of youth
        Singing it to the cold night light for all eternity
        Smells in the wind of this unknown land reminding me of times past`,
